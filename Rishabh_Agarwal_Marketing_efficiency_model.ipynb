    "In the beginning a business use case was defined to increase the efficiency in targeting customers for long-term deposit subscriptions, that means build a model that identifies which are more likely to subscribe. By doing so, marketing efforts can be focused more on those clients rather than people who are unlikely to subscribe. A baseline performance of 0.5 was defined as well. After creating and testing four different models (Logitstic Regression, KNEighbors, Decision Tree, and SVM) the result was that all models except logisitic regression beat the baseline goal by having a train and test score of above 0.88. KNN had the fastest training time in the initial model, but it had the second highest test accuracy. In effort to make KNN the optimal model, hyperparamter tuning was done. In order to do so the optimal values were found (neighbors = 11, algorithm = auto, weights = uniform). Running the KNN model with these values made it more accurate with the test score, but still lower in the train score. With slight adjusting of values for any model, an accuracy close 1.000 can be achieved.  "
